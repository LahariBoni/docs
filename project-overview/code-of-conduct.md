# Code of Conduct

We as a community cherish each member's contribution and make every effort to make it enjoyable for each participant. We are driven to assist newcomers who want to learn and advance their skills.

We are confident that members of our community will cooperate to create a supportive environment. We encourage community members to affirm the provided code of conduct to clarify what we expect from the members and preserve the spirit of the Naas community.

**Be respectful:** Disagreements occur, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one

**Be considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions\
\
**Be hospitable:** We make an effort to be a community that embraces and supports people from various identities and backgrounds. Do not engage in discriminatory behavior, including racism, sexism, ageism, transphobia, or otherwise exclusionary behavior.

**Keep it public:** Do not contact individual members of this community without their explicit permission, independent of reason. Try to keep the conversations as transparent as possible.

**Don't overuse tags:** In general, refrain from tagging community members for help or queries. You'll discover that the majority of our network of volunteers are incredibly accommodating and helpful! As previously stated, feel free to ping @support if you don't hear back from us.

**Be cordial and patient:** Instead of asking the same question again after waiting for an answer, go back and clarify it. Ping @support if you still believe you haven't gotten a sufficient response.

**Check off any questions that have been answered:** If you posted a question on Slack and got an insightful response, please add a ✅ reaction to the original post to indicate the question as answered.

**No inbound marketing:** Vendors are welcome to promote their goods in #shameless-plugs. It's against the rules to advertise your product elsewhere, especially in direct messages (DMs). We appreciate it when vendors and recruits utilize their Slack username to identify themselves.

**Avoid posting the same question several times:** If you ask a question and don't receive a response, check your query for clarity and make revisions rather than posting it again. Ping  support at hello@naas.ai if you still believe you haven't gotten a sufficient response.

**Use threads to facilitate conversation:** Threads let us scope discussions without burying messages beforehand! They enable us to be well-organized when responding to inquiries and significantly reduce the time it takes for us to do so.

Please alert a member of the Naas team if you see or receive a direct message that breaks any of these rules, and we will take the necessary moderation action right away. Hate speech and willful rule-breaking are not tolerated here.
