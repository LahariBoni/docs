## Coming within a few weeks/months

We understand that we're not "production-ready" for a lot of companies yet. In the end, we just got started in July 2020, so we're at the beginning of the journey. Here is a highlight of the main features we are planning on releasing in the next few months:

**Landing in July or so:**

* 0Auth login method to auto-connect with Google, LinkedIn, Github
* Improvements to the onboarding experience.
* Support of most popular databases.
* Support of data lakes

**Coming a bit later:**

* Our credit management interface.
* Collaboration features from JupyterLab release 3.0.
