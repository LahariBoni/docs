# Introduction

The Naas is an open-source project, it transforms Jupyter Notebooks in a safe production environment thanks to [micro-services](https://docs.naas.ai/)\(like a scheduler\) accessible in « low-code ».  


The product is based on 3 elements: features, drivers and templates.  
The **templates** enable "data geeks" to kickstart projects in minutes, the low-code **drivers** act as connectors to facilitate access to tools, and complex libraries \(database, API, ML algorithm...\) while the low-code **features** \(scheduling, asset sharing, notifications...\) enable faster iteration and deployment of outputs to end users, in a headless manner.  


Naas is forever free to use with 100 credits/month.
