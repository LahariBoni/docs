This notebook enables you to get a dataframe of all the team members in a Github organization.

## Input

### Import libraries


```python
from naas_drivers import github
```

### Setup Github

**How to find your personal access token on Github?** 
- First we need to create a personal access token to get the details of our organization from here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- You will be asked to select scopes for the token. Which scopes you choose will determine what information and actions you will be able to perform against the API. 
- You should be careful with the ones prefixed with write:, delete: and admin: as these might be quite destructive. 
- You can find description of each scope in docs here (https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).


### Variables


```python
TEAM_URL = "https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-naas/teams"

GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_PITkKHTBIbcXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

## Model


```python
df_teams = github.connect(GITHUB_TOKEN).teams.get_profiles(TEAM_URL)
```

## Output


```python
print(f'Dataset size -> {df_teams.shape}')
df_teams.head(25)
```
