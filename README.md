## :sparkles: Welcome to Naas!

Notebooks as a service (Naas) is an open source platform that allows anyone touching data (business analysts, scientists and engineers) to create powerful data engines combining automation, analytics and AI from the comfort of their Jupyter notebooks.

Naas is an attempt to propose an alternative to Google Colab, powered by the community.

In addition to Google Colab, Naas platform upgrade notebooks with with 3 low-code layers: features, drivers, templates.

* **Templates** enable the user to create automated data jobs and reports in minutes.
* **Drivers** act as connectors to push and/or pull data from databases, APIs, and Machine Learning algorithms and more.
* **Features** transform Jupyter in a production ready environment with scheduling, asset sharing, and notifications.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Try all of Naas's features for free using -- [Naas cloud](https://app.naas.ai/hub/login) -- a stable environment, without having to install anything.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

We value all kinds of contributions - not just code. We are paticularly motivated to support new contributors and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills.

## How does it work?

### Start with templates&#x20;

The easiest way to go is simply to find the right template for you.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="templates.md" %}
[templates.md](templates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Naas services

Naas creates a dynamic production environment for your Notebooks. Each time you run the following formulas in a notebook, it will be sent into the "‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Üí Production" folder" for execution. &#x20;

To get started, create a folder, open a notebook, and import Naas :

```python
import naas
```

### Schedule your notebook

Send in production this notebook and run it, every day at 9:00&#x20;

```python
naas.scheduler.add(cron="0 9 * * *")
```

{% content-ref url="features/scheduler.md" %}
[scheduler.md](features/scheduler.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a dependency

Send in production any file type like `test.csv` as a dependency:

```python
naas.dependency.add("test.csv")
```

{% content-ref url="features/dependency.md" %}
[dependency.md](features/dependency.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a secret key

Copy in production any secret key :

```python
naas.secret.add(name="API_NAME", secret="API_KEY")
```

Remove the previous line and get your secret key with :

```python
naas.secret.get(name="MY_API_KEY")
```

This allows you to push your notebook in production without sensitive data getting exposed.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="features/secret.md" %}
[secret.md](features/secret.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Trigger Webhook

Copy in production this notebook and allow to run it by calling the returned URL:

```python
naas.webhook.add()
```

Call the URL with your navigator you will get a message and see the notebook has run.

If you want to download the notebook result instead, add this line:&#x20;

```python
naas.webhook.respond_notebook()
```

{% content-ref url="features/api.md" %}
[api.md](features/api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Expose assets

Copy in production this asset ( file ) and allow to get it by calling the returned url:

```python
link = naas.assets.add("tesla-chart.html")
```

{% content-ref url="features/asset.md" %}
[asset.md](features/asset.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Send notifications

Send an email notification to anyone, to notify about data changes, alert on notebooks operations, etc...

```python
# Get link var from previous step
email = "elon@musk.com"
subject = "The tesla action is going up"
content = "check in the link the chart data maide from fresh dataset : " + link
naas.notifications.send(email=email, subject=subject, content=content)
```

{% content-ref url="features/notification.md" %}
[notification.md](features/notification.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Help

### Open

If at any time you are lost, you need help, or just want some info!

```python
import naas

naas.open_help()
```

That will open a chat box with us

### Close help chat

```python
import naas

naas.close_help()
```
