description: How to start using Naas in minutes.
---

# Quickstart

Naas **augments Jupyter Notebooks** by adding micro-services accessible in low-code **to easily access data, automation, and AI.**

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-27 at 02.42.14.png>)

The product is based on 3 elements: **features, drivers, and templates.**

\
The **templates** enable "data geeks" to kickstart projects in minutes. They may include low-code **drivers** that act as super connectors to facilitate access to tools, and complex libraries (database, API, ML algorithm...) while the low-code **features** (scheduling, asset sharing, notifications...) enable faster iteration and deployment of outputs to end-users, in a headless way.\


Naas is forever free to use with 100 credits/month on its hosted version [www.naas.ai](https://www.naas.ai).\

## Local installation

If you want to use Naas on your local Jupyter environment, it's free and open-source, just follow the procedure below  :&#x20;

{% content-ref url="advanced/local-install.md" %}
[local-install.md](advanced/local-install.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Why Naas?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Jupyter Notebooks are awesome, but using them in production can be risky & messy.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Naas allows Jupyter Notebooks to become a safe production environment!
{% endhint %}

## Basic features

Naas makes a dynamic production environment based on your current notebook folder.

Create a folder, open a notebook, and import Naas :

```python
import naas
```

### Schedule your notebook

Send in production this notebook and run it, every day at 9:00&#x20;

```python
# do stuff in your notebook
naas.scheduler.add(recurrence="0 9 * * *")
```

{% content-ref url="features/scheduler.md" %}
[scheduler.md](features/scheduler.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a dependency

Send in production any file type like `test.csv` as a dependency:

```python
naas.dependency.add("test.csv")
```

{% content-ref url="features/dependency.md" %}
[dependency.md](features/dependency.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add a secret key

Copy in production any secret key :

```python
naas.secret.add(name="API_NAME", secret="API_KEY")
```

Remove the previous line and get your secret key with :

```python
naas.secret.get(name="MY_API_KEY")
```

This allows you to push your notebook in production without sensitive data getting exposed.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="features/secret.md" %}
[secret.md](features/secret.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Advanced features

If you use Naas cloud they all work natively, otherwise go to :

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Use Notebooks as API

Copy in production this notebook and allow to run it by calling the returned URL:

```python
naas.api.add()
```

Call the URL with your navigator you will get a message and see the notebook has run.

If you want to download the notebook result instead, add this line:&#x20;

```python
naas.api.respond_notebook()
```

{% content-ref url="features/api.md" %}
[api.md](features/api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Expose assets

Copy in production this asset ( file ) and allow to get it by calling the returned url:

```python
link = naas.assets.add("tesla-chart.html")
```

{% content-ref url="features/asset.md" %}
[asset.md](features/asset.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Send notifications

Send an email notification to anyone, to notify about data changes, alert on notebooks operations, etc...

```python
# Get link var from previous step
email = "elon@musk.com"
subject = "The tesla action is going up"
content = "check in the link the chart data maide from fresh dataset : " + link
naas.notifications.send(email=email, subject=subject, content=content)
```

{% content-ref url="features/notification.md" %}
[notification.md](features/notification.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
