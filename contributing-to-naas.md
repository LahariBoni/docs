### Code of conduct

Please follow our [Code of conduct](project-overview/code-of-conduct.md) in the context of any contributions made to Naas.

### Commit convention

We follow the [**Conventional Commits specification**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)**.** It is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top.

In Naas, we use the following  commit elements to communicate:

1. `fix:` to patch a bug&#x20;
2. `feat:`to introduce a new feature&#x20;
3. `docs:` to document a feature or a fix
4. `style:` to change the UX design of a feature
5. `refactor:`to change the way a feature works&#x20;
6. `test:`to add unitary tests to the project&#x20;

This commit convention applies to Naas and Naas drivers repository.
